MindHue is a simple full-stack web application designed to let users log their daily moods by choosing a color and writing a short note. The project demonstrates full integration between the front end and back end using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

This app allows users to:

Select a mood color

Type a note

Save the entry

Automatically load previously saved moods from MongoDB

Each entry is stored in a MongoDB Atlas database and displayed in real time without page reloads.
